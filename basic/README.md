# Basic example
This example shows how to use the p2p discover, tcp client/server and http server. The example app can either act as a server or a client.

# How to run the example
The easiest way to test this is probably to bundle a desktop application and copy and run it on multiple computers, all connected to the same network.

If you don't have access to more than one computer then you can also start multiple instances on a single computers. On OSX you start multiple instances of an application like this:

	open -n /path/to/DefNet.app

IMPORTANT: Note that all clients have to be connected to the same network for them to find each other.
